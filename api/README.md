The uno api service.

Formerly `ror`, after Th[ror]: a dwarf with a big vault.



You can run minio (local S3) using Docker like so:

`docker run --name minio --rm -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 minio/minio server /tmp/data --console-address :9001`

This is useful for testing, and for having a local client for testing other parts of the platform...
